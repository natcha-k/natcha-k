Hi, I’m Natcha or Judy. I like to Eat, Travel, Play Moba games and Sleep.

Here for my professional stuffs and showcases~
Precisely, I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science and Analytics at the University of Calgary in Canada.

Okay! Some background. I was a Technology Consulting Manager at Accenture Thailand. My 6.5-year journey has been with financial services, where I have worked in many roles: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Deployment/Release Manager, and Integration Specialist. I grew up from an analyst starting in 2018. I can share with you an entire day of my experience.

How busy is Southeast Asia's banking business? For example, we launch new features for mobile banking every two months. What are those features launched for end-user use? Are they really generating revenues?
